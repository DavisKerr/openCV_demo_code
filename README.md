# Overview

This contains three simple programs. The first accepts a video and will try to draw lines around any upper bodies 
found in the video to a dot drawn on the screen. The second takes tow folders of faces and trains a openCV's face
recognizer to tell them apart. The final part takes in the face recognizer and determines what face has been shown
to it.

The purpose of creating this software is to reinforce how to demonstrate what I have been doing to learn openCV.


# Development Environment

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code.

This program was made using Python, openCV, and numpy.

Haar Cascades from the openCV github were used for this project.
